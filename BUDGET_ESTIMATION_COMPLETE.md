## 🎯 How It Works

### Smart Meal Detection Algorithm

The system intelligently determines which meals are needed based on:

1. **Trip Duration**:
   - **2-3 hours**: 1 meal + 1 snack
   - **4-6 hours** (half day): Lunch + 2 snacks
   - **8+ hours** (full day): Lunch + Dinner + 2 snacks

2. **Scheduled Times**: Analyzes each place's `scheduledTime` to detect:
   - Breakfast: 7:00-10:00
   - Lunch: 12:00-15:00
   - Dinner: 18:00-22:00

3. **Restaurant Detection**: Identifies explicit dining stops in itinerary

### Budget Levels & Multipliers

The system supports 4 budget levels with realistic multipliers:

| Budget Level | Food | Activities | Transport | Use Case |
|-------------|------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Budget-Friendly** | 0.6x | 0.5x | 0.7x | Backpackers, students |
| **Moderate** | 1.0x | 1.0x | 1.0x | Average tourists |
| **Premium** | 1.8x | 1.5x | 1.3x | Comfort seekers |
| **Luxury** | 3.0x | 2.5x | 2.0x | High-end travelers |

### Activity Costs (Entry Fees)

Category-specific realistic pricing:

- **Museums**: ₹200 per person
- **Monuments/Landmarks**: ₹250 per person
- **Parks/Gardens**: ₹100 per person
- **Shopping/Malls**: ₹500 per person (shopping budget)
- **Entertainment/Theater**: ₹400 per person
- **Default**: ₹150 per person

### Transport Costs

- **Base rate**: ₹80 per stop (moderate budget)
- Represents realistic mix of:
  - Auto-rickshaw: ₹50-100
  - Cab/Ola/Uber: ₹150-300
  - Public transport: ₹20-50
